        <p>We apply nonlinear methods on combined annual tree-ring reconstructed and gauged streamflow in the Upper Colorado River Basin. 
          First, we explore the connections between predictability and streamflow characteristics through the calculation of Lyapunov Exponents
          for the Lees Ferry gauge. Then, we test for spatial coherence of predictability for gauges on the main tributaries such as gauges along 
          the Green River, Gunnison River, and Colorado River.

        <h3>Quantifying Trends in Surface Water Inundation in the Colorado River Basin</h3>

        <p> Using the Global Surface Water Dataset we explore the evolving surface water trends in the Colorado River Basin. The dataset in this study 
          classifies water seasonality annually from Landsat 30m by 30m pixels. The seasonal classification of pixels is permanent water, seasonal water, 
          no water, and no observation. This dataset is used for us to explore the loss and gain of surface water across the Colorado River Basin.
