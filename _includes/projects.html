        <p>This work entails the application of nonlinear methods on annual tree-ring reconstructed streamflow in the Upper Colorado River Basin. 
          We explore the connections between predictability through the calcualtion of Lyapunov Exponents and streamflow characteristics and do 
          a test for spatial conherence. [work is soon to be submitted]
